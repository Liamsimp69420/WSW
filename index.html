    <section id="about">
        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>WSW was founded after our CEO, William, saw a watch that his friend had pulled apart, the watch had its dial pulled off and William fell in love with the design.<br><br>Using this 'no-dial' design William designed the company's first watch: the <b>William Severin One</b>. The <b>William Severin One</b> sported blue hands and a blue and white striped NATO strap.<br><br>Later that year, WSW released the <b>William Severin Two</b>, the <b>William Severin Two</b> features red hands and a Khaki strap while keeping the theme of not having a dial similar to the <b>William Severin One</b>.<br><br>Now the company makes all sorts of watches tailored to the customer's taste and is currently working on a sporty chronograph.</p>
